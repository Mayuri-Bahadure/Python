    "string.ascii_lowercase: This constant contains all lowercase ASCII letters ('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'). It is used to include lowercase letters in the password.\n",
    "\n",
    "string.ascii_uppercase: Similar to string.ascii_lowercase, this constant contains all uppercase ASCII letters ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'). It is used to include uppercase letters in the password.\n",
    "\n",
    "string.digits: This constant contains all the digits ('0123456789'). It is used to include digits in the password.\n",
    "\n",
    "string.punctuation: This constant contains all punctuation characters ('!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~'). It is used to include symbols in the password.\n",
    "\n",
    "random.sample(): This function is used to generate a random sample from a given sequence (in this case, the combine string) of a specified length (length). It returns a list of unique characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "random.choice(): As mentioned earlier, random.choice() is used to select a random element from a sequence, but in this code, random.sample() is used instead to ensure uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "password: This variable stores the generated password. It is constructed by joining the characters in the random sample (x) into a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion: The function pass1() is called recursively at the end to restart the process of generating a password after displaying the previous one. However, this can lead to an infinite loop if not controlled properly. It's better to use a loop construct like a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input."
